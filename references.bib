abstract="We present novel variants of the dual-lattice attack against LWE in the presence of an unusually short secret. These variants are informed by recent progress in BKW-style algorithms for solving LWE. Applying them to parameter sets suggested by the homomorphic encryption libraries HElib and SEAL yields revised security estimates. Our techniques scale the exponent of the dual-lattice attack by a factor of {\$}{\$}(2{\backslash},L)/(2{\backslash},L+1){\$}{\$}when {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log q = {\backslash}varTheta {\{}{\backslash}left( L {\backslash}log n{\backslash}right) {\}}{\$}{\$}, when the secret has constant hamming weight {\$}{\$}h{\$}{\$}and where {\$}{\$}L{\$}{\$}is the maximum depth of supported circuits. They also allow to half the dimension of the lattice under consideration at a multiplicative cost of {\$}{\$}2^{\{}h{\}}{\$}{\$}operations. Moreover, our techniques yield revised concrete security estimates. For example, both libraries promise 80 bits of security for LWE instances with {\$}{\$}n=1024{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log {\_}2 q {\backslash}approx {\{}47{\}}{\$}{\$}, while the techniques described in this work lead to estimated costs of 68 bits (SEAL) and 62 bits (HElib).",

abstract="Bounded Distance Decoding (BDD) is a basic lattice problem used in cryptanalysis: the security of most lattice-based encryption schemes relies on the hardness of some BDD, such as LWE. We study how to solve BDD using a classical method for finding shortest vectors in lattices: enumeration with pruning speedup, such as Gama-Nguyen-Regev extreme pruning from EUROCRYPT '10. We obtain significant improvements upon Lindner-Peikert's Search-LWE algorithm (from CT-RSA '11), and update experimental cryptanalytic results, such as attacks on DSA with partially known nonces and GGH encryption challenges. Our work shows that any security estimate of BDD-based cryptosystems must take into account enumeration attacks, and that BDD enumeration can be practical even in high dimension like 350.",

Our main contributions are: (1) a new lattice attack on LWE that combines basis reduction with an enumeration algorithm admitting a time/success tradeoff, which performs better than the simple distinguishing attack considered in prior analyses; (2) concrete parameters and security estimates for an LWE-based cryptosystem that is more compact and efficient than the well-known schemes from the literature. Our new key sizes are up to 10 times smaller than prior examples, while providing even stronger concrete security levels.",

The book begins by focusing on private-key cryptography, including an extensive treatment of private-key encryption, message authentication codes, and hash functions. The authors also present design principles for widely used stream ciphers and block ciphers including RC4, DES, and AES, plus provide provable constructions of stream ciphers and block ciphers from lower-level primitives.},

A number of algorithms have been proposed for solving SVP exactly or approximately, and most of them are useful also for solving CVP. In this paper, we give a survey of typical algorithms for solving SVP from a mathematical point of view.

    abstract = {Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as SVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the 'learning from parity with error' problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for SVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical.Using the main result, we obtain a public-key cryptosystem whose hardness is based on the worst-case quantum hardness of SVP and SIVP. Previous lattice-based public-key cryptosystems such as the one by Ajtai and Dwork were only based on unique-SVP, a special case of SVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous cryptosystems: the public key is of size \~{O}(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by \~{O}(n)(in previous cryptosystems these values are \~{O}(n4) and \~{O}(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \~{O}(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \~{O}(n).},

abstract="The two traditional hard problems underlying the security of lattice-based cryptography are the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest vector problem (CVP). For a long time, lattice enumeration was considered the fastest method for solving these problems in high dimensions, but recent work on memory-intensive methods has resulted in lattice sieving overtaking enumeration both in theory and in practice. Some of the recent improvements [Ducas, Eurocrypt 2018; Laarhoven--Mariano, PQCrypto 2018; Albrecht--Ducas--Herold--Kirshanova--Postlethwaite--Stevens, 2018] are based on the fact that these methods find more than just one short lattice vector, and this additional data can be reused effectively later on to solve other, closely related problems faster. Similarly, results for the preprocessing version of CVP (CVPP) have demonstrated that once this initial data has been generated, instances of CVP can be solved faster than when solving them directly, albeit with worse memory complexities [Laarhoven, SAC 2016].",
